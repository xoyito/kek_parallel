PSALMS 29
A psalm of David.
1Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings,
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
2Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name;
worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness.
3The voice of the Lord is over the waters;
the God of glory thunders,
the Lord thunders over the mighty waters.
4The voice of the Lord is powerful;
the voice of the Lord is majestic.
5The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars;
the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
6He makes Lebanon leap like a calf,
Sirion like a young wild ox.
7The voice of the Lord strikes
with flashes of lightning.
8The voice of the Lord shakes the desert;
the Lord shakes the Desert of Kadesh.
9The voice of the Lord twists the oaks
and strips the forests bare.
And in his temple all cry, “Glory!”
10The Lord sits enthroned over the flood;
the Lord is enthroned as King forever.
11The Lord gives strength to his people;
the Lord blesses his people with peace.
