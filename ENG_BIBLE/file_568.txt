PSALMS 90
BOOK IV
Psalms 90–106
A prayer of Moses the man of God.
1Lord, you have been our dwelling place
throughout all generations.
2Before the mountains were born
or you brought forth the whole world,
from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
3You turn people back to dust,
saying, “Return to dust, you mortals.”
4A thousand years in your sight
are like a day that has just gone by,
or like a watch in the night.
5Yet you sweep people away in the sleep of death—
they are like the new grass of the morning:
6In the morning it springs up new,
but by evening it is dry and withered.
7We are consumed by your anger
and terrified by your indignation.
8You have set our iniquities before you,
our secret sins in the light of your presence.
9All our days pass away under your wrath;
we finish our years with a moan.
10Our days may come to seventy years,
or eighty, if our strength endures;
yet the best of them are but trouble and sorrow,
for they quickly pass, and we fly away.
11If only we knew the power of your anger!
Your wrath is as great as the fear that is your due.
12Teach us to number our days,
that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
13Relent, Lord! How long will it be?
Have compassion on your servants.
14Satisfy us in the morning with your unfailing love,
that we may sing for joy and be glad all our days.
15Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
for as many years as we have seen trouble.
16May your deeds be shown to your servants,
your splendor to their children.
17May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us;
establish the work of our hands for us—
yes, establish the work of our hands.
