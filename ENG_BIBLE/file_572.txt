PSALMS 94
1The Lord is a God who avenges.
O God who avenges, shine forth.
2Rise up, Judge of the earth;
pay back to the proud what they deserve.
3How long, Lord, will the wicked,
how long will the wicked be jubilant?
4They pour out arrogant words;
all the evildoers are full of boasting.
5They crush your people, Lord;
they oppress your inheritance.
6They slay the widow and the foreigner;
they murder the fatherless.
7They say, “The Lord does not see;
the God of Jacob takes no notice.”
8Take notice, you senseless ones among the people;
you fools, when will you become wise?
9Does he who fashioned the ear not hear?
Does he who formed the eye not see?
10Does he who disciplines nations not punish?
Does he who teaches mankind lack knowledge?
11The Lord knows all human plans;
he knows that they are futile.
12Blessed is the one you discipline, Lord,
the one you teach from your law;
13you grant them relief from days of trouble,
till a pit is dug for the wicked.
14For the Lord will not reject his people;
he will never forsake his inheritance.
15Judgment will again be founded on righteousness,
and all the upright in heart will follow it.
16Who will rise up for me against the wicked?
Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?
17Unless the Lord had given me help,
I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.
18When I said, “My foot is slipping,”
your unfailing love, Lord, supported me.
19When anxiety was great within me,
your consolation brought me joy.
20Can a corrupt throne be allied with you—
a throne that brings on misery by its decrees?
21The wicked band together against the righteous
and condemn the innocent to death.
22But the Lord has become my fortress,
and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.
23He will repay them for their sins
and destroy them for their wickedness;
the Lord our God will destroy them.
