PSALMS 26
Of David.
1Vindicate me, Lord,
for I have led a blameless life;
I have trusted in the Lord
and have not faltered.
2Test me, Lord, and try me,
examine my heart and my mind;
3for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love
and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness.
4I do not sit with the deceitful,
nor do I associate with hypocrites.
5I abhor the assembly of evildoers
and refuse to sit with the wicked.
6I wash my hands in innocence,
and go about your altar, Lord,
7proclaiming aloud your praise
and telling of all your wonderful deeds.
8 Lord, I love the house where you live,
the place where your glory dwells.
9Do not take away my soul along with sinners,
my life with those who are bloodthirsty,
10in whose hands are wicked schemes,
whose right hands are full of bribes.
11I lead a blameless life;
deliver me and be merciful to me.
12My feet stand on level ground;
in the great congregation I will praise the Lord.
