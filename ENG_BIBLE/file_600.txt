PSALMS 122
A song of ascents. Of David.
1I rejoiced with those who said to me,
“Let us go to the house of the Lord.”
2Our feet are standing
in your gates, Jerusalem.
3Jerusalem is built like a city
that is closely compacted together.
4That is where the tribes go up—
the tribes of the Lord—
to praise the name of the Lord
according to the statute given to Israel.
5There stand the thrones for judgment,
the thrones of the house of David.
6Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:
“May those who love you be secure.
7May there be peace within your walls
and security within your citadels.”
8For the sake of my family and friends,
I will say, “Peace be within you.”
9For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,
I will seek your prosperity.
