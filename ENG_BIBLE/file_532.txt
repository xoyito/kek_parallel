PSALMS 54
For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David. When the Ziphites had gone to Saul and said, “Is not David hiding among us?”
1Save me, O God, by your name;
vindicate me by your might.
2Hear my prayer, O God;
listen to the words of my mouth.
3Arrogant foes are attacking me;
ruthless people are trying to kill me—
people without regard for God.
4Surely God is my help;
the Lord is the one who sustains me.
5Let evil recoil on those who slander me;
in your faithfulness destroy them.
6I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you;
I will praise your name, Lord, for it is good.
7You have delivered me from all my troubles,
and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
