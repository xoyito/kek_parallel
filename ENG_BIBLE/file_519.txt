PSALMS 41
For the director of music. A psalm of David.
1Blessed are those who have regard for the weak;
the Lord delivers them in times of trouble.
2The Lord protects and preserves them—
they are counted among the blessed in the land—
he does not give them over to the desire of their foes.
3The Lord sustains them on their sickbed
and restores them from their bed of illness.
4I said, “Have mercy on me, Lord;
heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
5My enemies say of me in malice,
“When will he die and his name perish?”
6When one of them comes to see me,
he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander;
then he goes out and spreads it around.
7All my enemies whisper together against me;
they imagine the worst for me, saying,
8“A vile disease has afflicted him;
he will never get up from the place where he lies.”
9Even my close friend,
someone I trusted,
one who shared my bread,
has turned against me.
10But may you have mercy on me, Lord;
raise me up, that I may repay them.
11I know that you are pleased with me,
for my enemy does not triumph over me.
12Because of my integrity you uphold me
and set me in your presence forever.
13Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
from everlasting to everlasting.
Amen and Amen.
