PSALMS 87
Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm. A song.
1He has founded his city on the holy mountain.
2The Lord loves the gates of Zion
more than all the other dwellings of Jacob.
3Glorious things are said of you,
city of God:
4“I will record Rahab and Babylon
among those who acknowledge me—
Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush—
and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’ ”
5Indeed, of Zion it will be said,
“This one and that one were born in her,
and the Most High himself will establish her.”
6The Lord will write in the register of the peoples:
“This one was born in Zion.”
7As they make music they will sing,
“All my fountains are in you.”
