PSALMS 64
For the director of music. A psalm of David.
1Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint;
protect my life from the threat of the enemy.
2Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked,
from the plots of evildoers.
3They sharpen their tongues like swords
and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.
4They shoot from ambush at the innocent;
they shoot suddenly, without fear.
5They encourage each other in evil plans,
they talk about hiding their snares;
they say, “Who will see it?”
6They plot injustice and say,
“We have devised a perfect plan!”
Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.
7But God will shoot them with his arrows;
they will suddenly be struck down.
8He will turn their own tongues against them
and bring them to ruin;
all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
9All people will fear;
they will proclaim the works of God
and ponder what he has done.
10The righteous will rejoice in the Lord
and take refuge in him;
all the upright in heart will glory in him!
