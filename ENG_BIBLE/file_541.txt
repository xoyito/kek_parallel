PSALMS 63
A psalm of David. When he was in the Desert of Judah.
1You, God, are my God,
earnestly I seek you;
I thirst for you,
my whole being longs for you,
in a dry and parched land
where there is no water.
2I have seen you in the sanctuary
and beheld your power and your glory.
3Because your love is better than life,
my lips will glorify you.
4I will praise you as long as I live,
and in your name I will lift up my hands.
5I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods;
with singing lips my mouth will praise you.
6On my bed I remember you;
I think of you through the watches of the night.
7Because you are my help,
I sing in the shadow of your wings.
8I cling to you;
your right hand upholds me.
9Those who want to kill me will be destroyed;
they will go down to the depths of the earth.
10They will be given over to the sword
and become food for jackals.
11But the king will rejoice in God;
all who swear by God will glory in him,
while the mouths of liars will be silenced.
