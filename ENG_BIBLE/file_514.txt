PSALMS 36
For the director of music. Of David the servant of the Lord.
1I have a message from God in my heart
concerning the sinfulness of the wicked:
There is no fear of God
before their eyes.
2In their own eyes they flatter themselves
too much to detect or hate their sin.
3The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful;
they fail to act wisely or do good.
4Even on their beds they plot evil;
they commit themselves to a sinful course
and do not reject what is wrong.
5Your love, Lord, reaches to the heavens,
your faithfulness to the skies.
6Your righteousness is like the highest mountains,
your justice like the great deep.
You, Lord, preserve both people and animals.
7How priceless is your unfailing love, O God!
People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
8They feast on the abundance of your house;
you give them drink from your river of delights.
9For with you is the fountain of life;
in your light we see light.
10Continue your love to those who know you,
your righteousness to the upright in heart.
11May the foot of the proud not come against me,
nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
12See how the evildoers lie fallen—
thrown down, not able to rise!
