PSALMS 149
1Praise the Lord.
Sing to the Lord a new song,
his praise in the assembly of his faithful people.
2Let Israel rejoice in their Maker;
let the people of Zion be glad in their King.
3Let them praise his name with dancing
and make music to him with timbrel and harp.
4For the Lord takes delight in his people;
he crowns the humble with victory.
5Let his faithful people rejoice in this honor
and sing for joy on their beds.
6May the praise of God be in their mouths
and a double-edged sword in their hands,
7to inflict vengeance on the nations
and punishment on the peoples,
8to bind their kings with fetters,
their nobles with shackles of iron,
9to carry out the sentence written against themâ€”
this is the glory of all his faithful people.
Praise the Lord.
