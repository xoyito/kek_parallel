PSALMS 132
A song of ascents.
1 Lord, remember David
and all his self-denial.
2He swore an oath to the Lord,
he made a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
3“I will not enter my house
or go to my bed,
4I will allow no sleep to my eyes
or slumber to my eyelids,
5till I find a place for the Lord,
a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
6We heard it in Ephrathah,
we came upon it in the fields of Jaar:
7“Let us go to his dwelling place,
let us worship at his footstool, saying,
8‘Arise, Lord, and come to your resting place,
you and the ark of your might.
9May your priests be clothed with your righteousness;
may your faithful people sing for joy.’ ”
10For the sake of your servant David,
do not reject your anointed one.
11The Lord swore an oath to David,
a sure oath he will not revoke:
“One of your own descendants
I will place on your throne.
12If your sons keep my covenant
and the statutes I teach them,
then their sons will sit
on your throne for ever and ever.”
13For the Lord has chosen Zion,
he has desired it for his dwelling, saying,
14“This is my resting place for ever and ever;
here I will sit enthroned, for I have desired it.
15I will bless her with abundant provisions;
her poor I will satisfy with food.
16I will clothe her priests with salvation,
and her faithful people will ever sing for joy.
17“Here I will make a horn grow for David
and set up a lamp for my anointed one.
18I will clothe his enemies with shame,
but his head will be adorned with a radiant crown.”
