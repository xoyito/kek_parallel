PSALMS 115
1Not to us, Lord, not to us
but to your name be the glory,
because of your love and faithfulness.
2Why do the nations say,
“Where is their God?”
3Our God is in heaven;
he does whatever pleases him.
4But their idols are silver and gold,
made by human hands.
5They have mouths, but cannot speak,
eyes, but cannot see.
6They have ears, but cannot hear,
noses, but cannot smell.
7They have hands, but cannot feel,
feet, but cannot walk,
nor can they utter a sound with their throats.
8Those who make them will be like them,
and so will all who trust in them.
9All you Israelites, trust in the Lord—
he is their help and shield.
10House of Aaron, trust in the Lord—
he is their help and shield.
11You who fear him, trust in the Lord—
he is their help and shield.
12The Lord remembers us and will bless us:
He will bless his people Israel,
he will bless the house of Aaron,
13he will bless those who fear the Lord—
small and great alike.
14May the Lord cause you to flourish,
both you and your children.
15May you be blessed by the Lord,
the Maker of heaven and earth.
16The highest heavens belong to the Lord,
but the earth he has given to mankind.
17It is not the dead who praise the Lord,
those who go down to the place of silence;
18it is we who extol the Lord,
both now and forevermore.
Praise the Lord.
