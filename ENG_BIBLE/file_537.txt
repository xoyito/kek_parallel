For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” Of David. A miktam. When Saul had sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him.
1Deliver me from my enemies, O God;
be my fortress against those who are attacking me.
2Deliver me from evildoers
and save me from those who are after my blood.
3See how they lie in wait for me!
Fierce men conspire against me
for no offense or sin of mine, Lord.
4I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.
Arise to help me; look on my plight!
5You, Lord God Almighty,
you who are the God of Israel,
rouse yourself to punish all the nations;
show no mercy to wicked traitors.
6They return at evening,
snarling like dogs,
and prowl about the city.
7See what they spew from their mouths—
the words from their lips are sharp as swords,
and they think, “Who can hear us?”
8But you laugh at them, Lord;
you scoff at all those nations.
9You are my strength, I watch for you;
you, God, are my fortress,
10my God on whom I can rely.
God will go before me
and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
11But do not kill them, Lord our shield,
or my people will forget.
In your might uproot them
and bring them down.
12For the sins of their mouths,
for the words of their lips,
let them be caught in their pride.
For the curses and lies they utter,
13consume them in your wrath,
consume them till they are no more.
Then it will be known to the ends of the earth
that God rules over Jacob.
14They return at evening,
snarling like dogs,
and prowl about the city.
15They wander about for food
and howl if not satisfied.
16But I will sing of your strength,
in the morning I will sing of your love;
for you are my fortress,
my refuge in times of trouble.
17You are my strength, I sing praise to you;
you, God, are my fortress,
my God on whom I can rely.
