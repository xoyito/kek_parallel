PSALMS 75
For the director of music. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A psalm of Asaph. A song.
1We praise you, God,
we praise you, for your Name is near;
people tell of your wonderful deeds.
2You say, “I choose the appointed time;
it is I who judge with equity.
3When the earth and all its people quake,
it is I who hold its pillars firm.
4To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’
and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.
5Do not lift your horns against heaven;
do not speak so defiantly.’ ”
6No one from the east or the west
or from the desert can exalt themselves.
7It is God who judges:
He brings one down, he exalts another.
8In the hand of the Lord is a cup
full of foaming wine mixed with spices;
he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth
drink it down to its very dregs.
9As for me, I will declare this forever;
I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,
10who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked,
but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”
