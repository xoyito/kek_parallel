JOB 25
Bildad
1Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
2“Dominion and awe belong to God;
he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
3Can his forces be numbered?
On whom does his light not rise?
4How then can a mortal be righteous before God?
How can one born of woman be pure?
5If even the moon is not bright
and the stars are not pure in his eyes,
6how much less a mortal, who is but a maggot—
a human being, who is only a worm!”
