PSALMS 21
For the director of music. A psalm of David.
1The king rejoices in your strength, Lord.
How great is his joy in the victories you give!
2You have granted him his heart’s desire
and have not withheld the request of his lips.
3You came to greet him with rich blessings
and placed a crown of pure gold on his head.
4He asked you for life, and you gave it to him—
length of days, for ever and ever.
5Through the victories you gave, his glory is great;
you have bestowed on him splendor and majesty.
6Surely you have granted him unending blessings
and made him glad with the joy of your presence.
7For the king trusts in the Lord;
through the unfailing love of the Most High
he will not be shaken.
8Your hand will lay hold on all your enemies;
your right hand will seize your foes.
9When you appear for battle,
you will burn them up as in a blazing furnace.
The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath,
and his fire will consume them.
10You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
their posterity from mankind.
11Though they plot evil against you
and devise wicked schemes, they cannot succeed.
12You will make them turn their backs
when you aim at them with drawn bow.
13Be exalted in your strength, Lord;
we will sing and praise your might.
