PSALMS 120
A song of ascents.
1I call on the Lord in my distress,
and he answers me.
2Save me, Lord,
from lying lips
and from deceitful tongues.
3What will he do to you,
and what more besides,
you deceitful tongue?
4He will punish you with a warriorâ€™s sharp arrows,
with burning coals of the broom bush.
5Woe to me that I dwell in Meshek,
that I live among the tents of Kedar!
6Too long have I lived
among those who hate peace.
7I am for peace;
but when I speak, they are for war.
