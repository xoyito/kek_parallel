PSALMS 45
For the director of music. To the tune of “Lilies.” Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. A wedding song.
1My heart is stirred by a noble theme
as I recite my verses for the king;
my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
2You are the most excellent of men
and your lips have been anointed with grace,
since God has blessed you forever.
3Gird your sword on your side, you mighty one;
clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
4In your majesty ride forth victoriously
in the cause of truth, humility and justice;
let your right hand achieve awesome deeds.
5Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies;
let the nations fall beneath your feet.
6Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever;
a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.
7You love righteousness and hate wickedness;
therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions
by anointing you with the oil of joy.
8All your robes are fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia;
from palaces adorned with ivory
the music of the strings makes you glad.
9Daughters of kings are among your honored women;
at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir.
10Listen, daughter, and pay careful attention:
Forget your people and your father’s house.
11Let the king be enthralled by your beauty;
honor him, for he is your lord.
12The city of Tyre will come with a gift,
people of wealth will seek your favor.
13All glorious is the princess within her chamber;
her gown is interwoven with gold.
14In embroidered garments she is led to the king;
her virgin companions follow her—
those brought to be with her.
15Led in with joy and gladness,
they enter the palace of the king.
16Your sons will take the place of your fathers;
you will make them princes throughout the land.
17I will perpetuate your memory through all generations;
therefore the nations will praise you for ever and ever.
