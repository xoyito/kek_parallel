1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant John Murdockâ€”thou art acalled to go into the eastern countries from house to house, from village to village, and from city to city, to proclaim mine everlasting gospel unto the inhabitants thereof, in the midst of bpersecution and wickedness.
2 And who areceiveth you receiveth me; and you shall have power to declare my word in the bdemonstration of my Holy Spirit.
3 And who receiveth you aas a little child, receiveth my bkingdom; and blessed are they, for they shall obtain cmercy.
4 And whoso rejecteth you shall be arejected of my Father and his house; and you shall cleanse your bfeet in the secret places by the way for a testimony against them.
5 And behold, and lo, I acome quickly to bjudgment, to convince all of their ungodly deeds which they have committed against me, as it is written of me in the volume of the book.
6 And now, verily I say unto you, that it is not expedient that you should go until your children are aprovided for, and sent up kindly unto the bishop of Zion.
7 And after a few years, if thou desirest of me, thou mayest go up also unto the goodly land, to possess thine ainheritance;
8 Otherwise thou shalt continue proclaiming my gospel auntil thou be taken. Amen.
