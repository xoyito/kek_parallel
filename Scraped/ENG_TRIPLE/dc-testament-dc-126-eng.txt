1 Dear and well-beloved brother, aBrigham Young, verily thus saith the Lord unto you: My servant Brigham, it is bno more required at your hand to leave your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.
2 I have seen your alabor and toil in journeyings for my name.
3 I therefore command you to asend my word abroad, and take especial bcare of your family from this time, henceforth and forever. Amen.
