1 Thus saith the Lord God, the aMighty One of Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my servant bEdward, that you are blessed, and your sins are forgiven you, and you are called to preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump;
2 And I will lay my ahand upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the bComforter, which shall cteach you the peaceable things of the kingdom;
3 And you shall declare it with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna, ablessed be the name of the most high God.
4 And now this calling and commandment give I unto you concerning all men—
5 That as many as shall come before my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., embracing this calling and commandment, shall be aordained and sent forth to bpreach the everlasting gospel among the nations—
6 Crying repentance, saying: aSave yourselves from this untoward generation, and come forth out of the fire, hating even the bgarments spotted with the flesh.
7 And this commandment shall be given unto the elders of my church, that every man which will aembrace it with bsingleness of heart may be ordained and sent forth, even as I have spoken.
8 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins and I will asuddenly bcome to my ctemple. Even so. Amen.
