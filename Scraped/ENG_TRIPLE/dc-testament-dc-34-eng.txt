1 My son aOrson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;
2 The alight and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;
3 Who so aloved the world that he bgave his own life, that as many as would believe might become the csons of God. Wherefore you are my son;
4 And ablessed are you because you have believed;
5 And more blessed are you because you are acalled of me to preach my gospel—
6 To lift up your voice as with the sound of a atrump, both long and loud, and bcry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, cpreparing the way of the Lord for his dsecond coming.
7 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the atime is soon at hand that I shall bcome in a ccloud with power and great glory.
8 And it shall be a agreat day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall btremble.
9 But before that great day shall come, the asun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.
10 Wherefore, lift up your voice and aspare not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore bprophesy, and it shall be given by the cpower of the Holy Ghost.
11 And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come—
12 And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come aquickly. I am your bLord and your Redeemer. Even so. Amen.
