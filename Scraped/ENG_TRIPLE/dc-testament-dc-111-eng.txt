1 I, the Lord your God, am anot displeased with your coming this journey, notwithstanding your follies.
2 I have much atreasure in this city for you, for the benefit of Zion, and many people in this city, whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit of Zion, through your instrumentality.
3 Therefore, it is expedient that you should form aacquaintance with men in this city, as you shall be led, and as it shall be given you.
4 And it shall come to pass in due time that I will agive this city into your hands, that you shall have power over it, insomuch that they shall not bdiscover your secret parts; and its wealth pertaining to gold and silver shall be yours.
5 Concern not yourselves about your adebts, for I will give you power to pay them.
6 Concern not yourselves about Zion, for I will deal mercifully with her.
7 Tarry in this place, and in the regions round about;
8 And the place where it is my will that you should tarry, for the main, shall be signalized unto you by the apeace and power of my bSpirit, that shall flow unto you.
9 This place you may obtain by hire. And inquire diligently concerning the more ancient inhabitants and founders of this city;
10 For there are more treasures than one for you in this city.
11 Therefore, be ye as awise as serpents and yet without bsin; and I will order all things for your cgood, as fast as ye are able to receive them. Amen.
