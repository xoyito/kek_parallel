1 The aheavens were bopened upon us, and I beheld the ccelestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether in the dbody or out I cannot tell.
2 I saw the transcendent abeauty of the bgate through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was clike unto dcircling flames of fire;
3 Also the ablazing bthrone of God, whereon was seated the cFather and the dSon.
4 I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with agold.
5 I saw Father aAdam and bAbraham; and my cfather and my mother; my brother dAlvin, that has long since eslept;
6 And amarveled how it was that he had obtained an binheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set his hand to cgather Israel the second time, and had not been dbaptized for the remission of sins.
7 Thus came the avoice of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died bwithout a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be cheirs of the celestial kingdom of God;
8 Also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who awould have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom;
9 For I, the Lord, will ajudge all men according to their bworks, according to the cdesire of their hearts.
10 And I also beheld that all achildren who die before they arrive at the byears of accountability are csaved in the celestial kingdom of heaven.
