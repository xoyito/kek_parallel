1 Verily thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom in my servant DavidÂ W. Patten, that he settle up all his business as soon as he possibly can, and make a disposition of his merchandise, that he may aperform a mission unto me next spring, in company with others, even twelve including himself, to testify of my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world.
2 For verily thus saith the Lord, that inasmuch as there are those among you who adeny my name, others shall be bplanted in their cstead and receive their dbishopric. Amen.
