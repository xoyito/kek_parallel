1 Verily, thus saith the Lord: Let a conference be held immediately; let the Twelve be organized; and let men be appointed to asupply the place of those who are fallen.
2 Let my servant aThomas remain for a season in the land of Zion, to publish my word.
3 Let the residue continue to preach from that hour, and if they will do this in all alowliness of heart, in meekness and humility, and blong-suffering, I, the Lord, give unto them a cpromise that I will provide for their families; and an effectual door shall be opened for them, from henceforth.
4 And next spring let them depart to go over the great waters, and there promulgate my gospel, the fulness thereof, and bear record of my name.
5 Let them atake leave of my saints in the city of Far West, on the btwenty-sixth day of April next, on the building-spot of my house, saith the Lord.
6 Let my servant John Taylor, and also my servant JohnÂ E. Page, and also my servant Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant Willard Richards, be appointed to fill the places of those who have afallen, and be officially notified of their appointment.
