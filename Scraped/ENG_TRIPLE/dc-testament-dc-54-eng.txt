1 Behold, thus saith the Lord, even aAlpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was bcrucified for the sins of the worldâ€”
2 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you.
3 And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly ahumble before me and contrite.
4 And as the covenant which they made unto me has been abroken, even so it has become bvoid and of none effect.
5 And wo to him by whom this aoffense cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea.
6 But blessed are they who have kept the acovenant and observed the bcommandment, for they shall obtain cmercy.
7 Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you.
8 And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of aMissouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.
9 And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a aliving like unto men, until I prepare a place for you.
10 And again, be apatient in tribulation until I bcome; and, behold, I come quickly, and my creward is with me, and they who have dsought me early shall find erest to their souls. Even so. Amen.
