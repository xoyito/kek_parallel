1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the alaws of the church concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have blost their husbands or fathers:
2 aWomen have bclaim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their chusbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church.
3 And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.
4 All achildren have claim upon their bparents for their cmaintenance until they are of age.
5 And after that, they have aclaim upon the church, or in other words upon the Lordâ€™s bstorehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances.
6 And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and awidows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the bpoor. Amen.
