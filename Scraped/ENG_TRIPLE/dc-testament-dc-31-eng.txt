1 aThomas, my son, blessed are you because of your faith in my work.
2 Behold, you have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and your afamily, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church.
3 Lift up your heart and rejoice, for the hour of your mission is come; and your tongue shall be loosed, and you shall declare aglad tidings of great joy unto this generation.
4 You shall adeclare the things which have been revealed to my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun. You shall begin to preach from this time forth, yea, to reap in the field which is bwhite already to be burned.
5 Therefore, athrust in your sickle with all your soul, and your sins are bforgiven you, and you shall be laden with csheaves upon your back, for the dlaborer is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family shall live.
6 Behold, verily I say unto you, go from them only for a little atime, and declare my word, and I will prepare a place for them.
7 Yea, I will aopen the hearts of the people, and they will receive you. And I will establish a church by your hand;
8 And you shall astrengthen them and prepare them against the time when they shall be gathered.
9 Be apatient in bafflictions, crevile not against those that revile. Govern your dhouse in meekness, and be esteadfast.
10 Behold, I say unto you that you shall be a physician unto the church, but not unto the world, for they will not receive you.
11 Go your way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the aComforter what you shall do and whither you shall go.
12 aPray always, lest you enter into btemptation and lose your creward.
13 Be afaithful unto the bend, and lo, I am cwith you. These words are not of man nor of men, but of me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the dwill of the Father. Amen.
