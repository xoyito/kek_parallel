1 aAnd in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.
2 Behold, God is my salvation; I will atrust, and not be afraid; for the Lord bJehovah is my cstrength and my dsong; he also has become my salvation.
3 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw awater out of the wells of salvation.
4 And in that day shall ye say: aPraise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.
5 aSing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.
6 aCry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
