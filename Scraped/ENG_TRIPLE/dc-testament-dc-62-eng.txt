1 Behold, and hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, your aadvocate, who knoweth the weakness of man and how to bsuccor them who are ctempted.
2 And verily mine eyes are upon those who have not as yet gone up unto the land of Zion; wherefore your mission is not yet full.
3 Nevertheless, ye are ablessed, for the btestimony which ye have borne is crecorded in heaven for the angels to look upon; and they rejoice over you, and your dsins are forgiven you.
4 And now continue your journey. Assemble yourselves upon the land of aZion; and hold a meeting and rejoice together, and offer a bsacrament unto the Most High.
5 And then you may return to bear record, yea, even altogether, or atwo by two, as seemeth you good, it mattereth not unto me; only be faithful, and bdeclare glad tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, or among the ccongregations of the wicked.
6 Behold, I, the Lord, have brought you together that the promise might be fulfilled, that the faithful among you should be preserved and rejoice together in the land of Missouri. I, the Lord, apromise the faithful and cannot blie.
7 I, the Lord, am willing, if any among you adesire to ride upon horses, or upon mules, or in chariots, he shall receive this blessing, if he receive it from the hand of the Lord, with a bthankful heart in all things.
8 These things remain with you to do according to judgment and the directions of the Spirit.
9 Behold, the akingdom is yours. And behold, and lo, I am bwith the faithful always. Even so. Amen.
