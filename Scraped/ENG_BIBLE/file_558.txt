PSALMS 80
For the director of music. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” Of Asaph. A psalm.
1Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,
you who lead Joseph like a flock.
You who sit enthroned between the cherubim,
shine forth 2before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh.
Awaken your might;
come and save us.
3Restore us, O God;
make your face shine on us,
that we may be saved.
4How long, Lord God Almighty,
will your anger smolder
against the prayers of your people?
5You have fed them with the bread of tears;
you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.
6You have made us an object of derision to our neighbors,
and our enemies mock us.
7Restore us, God Almighty;
make your face shine on us,
that we may be saved.
8You transplanted a vine from Egypt;
you drove out the nations and planted it.
9You cleared the ground for it,
and it took root and filled the land.
10The mountains were covered with its shade,
the mighty cedars with its branches.
11Its branches reached as far as the Sea,
its shoots as far as the River.
12Why have you broken down its walls
so that all who pass by pick its grapes?
13Boars from the forest ravage it,
and insects from the fields feed on it.
14Return to us, God Almighty!
Look down from heaven and see!
Watch over this vine,
15the root your right hand has planted,
the son you have raised up for yourself.
16Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire;
at your rebuke your people perish.
17Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand,
the son of man you have raised up for yourself.
18Then we will not turn away from you;
revive us, and we will call on your name.
19Restore us, Lord God Almighty;
make your face shine on us,
that we may be saved.
