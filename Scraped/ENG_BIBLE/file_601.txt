PSALMS 123
A song of ascents.
1I lift up my eyes to you,
to you who sit enthroned in heaven.
2As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master,
as the eyes of a female slave look to the hand of her mistress,
so our eyes look to the Lord our God,
till he shows us his mercy.
3Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us,
for we have endured no end of contempt.
4We have endured no end
of ridicule from the arrogant,
of contempt from the proud.
