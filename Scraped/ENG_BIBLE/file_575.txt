PSALMS 97
1The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad;
let the distant shores rejoice.
2Clouds and thick darkness surround him;
righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
3Fire goes before him
and consumes his foes on every side.
4His lightning lights up the world;
the earth sees and trembles.
5The mountains melt like wax before the Lord,
before the Lord of all the earth.
6The heavens proclaim his righteousness,
and all peoples see his glory.
7All who worship images are put to shame,
those who boast in idolsâ€”
worship him, all you gods!
8Zion hears and rejoices
and the villages of Judah are glad
because of your judgments, Lord.
9For you, Lord, are the Most High over all the earth;
you are exalted far above all gods.
10Let those who love the Lord hate evil,
for he guards the lives of his faithful ones
and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
11Light shines on the righteous
and joy on the upright in heart.
12Rejoice in the Lord, you who are righteous,
and praise his holy name.
