PSALMS 85
For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.
1You, Lord, showed favor to your land;
you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
2You forgave the iniquity of your people
and covered all their sins.
3You set aside all your wrath
and turned from your fierce anger.
4Restore us again, God our Savior,
and put away your displeasure toward us.
5Will you be angry with us forever?
Will you prolong your anger through all generations?
6Will you not revive us again,
that your people may rejoice in you?
7Show us your unfailing love, Lord,
and grant us your salvation.
8I will listen to what God the Lord says;
he promises peace to his people, his faithful servantsâ€”
but let them not turn to folly.
9Surely his salvation is near those who fear him,
that his glory may dwell in our land.
10Love and faithfulness meet together;
righteousness and peace kiss each other.
11Faithfulness springs forth from the earth,
and righteousness looks down from heaven.
12The Lord will indeed give what is good,
and our land will yield its harvest.
13Righteousness goes before him
and prepares the way for his steps.
