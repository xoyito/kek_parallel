PSALMS 110
Of David. A psalm.
1The Lord says to my lord:
“Sit at my right hand
until I make your enemies
a footstool for your feet.”
2The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion, saying,
“Rule in the midst of your enemies!”
3Your troops will be willing
on your day of battle.
Arrayed in holy splendor,
your young men will come to you
like dew from the morning’s womb.
4The Lord has sworn
and will not change his mind:
“You are a priest forever,
in the order of Melchizedek.”
5The Lord is at your right hand;
he will crush kings on the day of his wrath.
6He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead
and crushing the rulers of the whole earth.
7He will drink from a brook along the way,
and so he will lift his head high.
