PSALMS 98
A psalm.
1Sing to the Lord a new song,
for he has done marvelous things;
his right hand and his holy arm
have worked salvation for him.
2The Lord has made his salvation known
and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
3He has remembered his love
and his faithfulness to Israel;
all the ends of the earth have seen
the salvation of our God.
4Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth,
burst into jubilant song with music;
5make music to the Lord with the harp,
with the harp and the sound of singing,
6with trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn—
shout for joy before the Lord, the King.
7Let the sea resound, and everything in it,
the world, and all who live in it.
8Let the rivers clap their hands,
let the mountains sing together for joy;
9let them sing before the Lord,
for he comes to judge the earth.
He will judge the world in righteousness
and the peoples with equity.
