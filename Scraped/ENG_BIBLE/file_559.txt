PSALMS 81
For the director of music. According to gittith. Of Asaph.
1Sing for joy to God our strength;
shout aloud to the God of Jacob!
2Begin the music, strike the timbrel,
play the melodious harp and lyre.
3Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon,
and when the moon is full, on the day of our festival;
4this is a decree for Israel,
an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
5When God went out against Egypt,
he established it as a statute for Joseph.
I heard an unknown voice say:
6“I removed the burden from their shoulders;
their hands were set free from the basket.
7In your distress you called and I rescued you,
I answered you out of a thundercloud;
I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
8Hear me, my people, and I will warn you—
if you would only listen to me, Israel!
9You shall have no foreign god among you;
you shall not worship any god other than me.
10I am the Lord your God,
who brought you up out of Egypt.
Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.
11“But my people would not listen to me;
Israel would not submit to me.
12So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts
to follow their own devices.
13“If my people would only listen to me,
if Israel would only follow my ways,
14how quickly I would subdue their enemies
and turn my hand against their foes!
15Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him,
and their punishment would last forever.
16But you would be fed with the finest of wheat;
with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
