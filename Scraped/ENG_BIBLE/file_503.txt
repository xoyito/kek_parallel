PSALMS 25
Of David.
1In you, Lord my God,
I put my trust.
2I trust in you;
do not let me be put to shame,
nor let my enemies triumph over me.
3No one who hopes in you
will ever be put to shame,
but shame will come on those
who are treacherous without cause.
4Show me your ways, Lord,
teach me your paths.
5Guide me in your truth and teach me,
for you are God my Savior,
and my hope is in you all day long.
6Remember, Lord, your great mercy and love,
for they are from of old.
7Do not remember the sins of my youth
and my rebellious ways;
according to your love remember me,
for you, Lord, are good.
8Good and upright is the Lord;
therefore he instructs sinners in his ways.
9He guides the humble in what is right
and teaches them his way.
10All the ways of the Lord are loving and faithful
toward those who keep the demands of his covenant.
11For the sake of your name, Lord,
forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
12Who, then, are those who fear the Lord?
He will instruct them in the ways they should choose.
13They will spend their days in prosperity,
and their descendants will inherit the land.
14The Lord confides in those who fear him;
he makes his covenant known to them.
15My eyes are ever on the Lord,
for only he will release my feet from the snare.
16Turn to me and be gracious to me,
for I am lonely and afflicted.
17Relieve the troubles of my heart
and free me from my anguish.
18Look on my affliction and my distress
and take away all my sins.
19See how numerous are my enemies
and how fiercely they hate me!
20Guard my life and rescue me;
do not let me be put to shame,
for I take refuge in you.
21May integrity and uprightness protect me,
because my hope, Lord, is in you.
22Deliver Israel, O God,
from all their troubles!
