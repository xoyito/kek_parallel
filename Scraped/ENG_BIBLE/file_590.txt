PSALMS 112
1Praise the Lord.
Blessed are those who fear the Lord,
who find great delight in his commands.
2Their children will be mighty in the land;
the generation of the upright will be blessed.
3Wealth and riches are in their houses,
and their righteousness endures forever.
4Even in darkness light dawns for the upright,
for those who are gracious and compassionate and righteous.
5Good will come to those who are generous and lend freely,
who conduct their affairs with justice.
6Surely the righteous will never be shaken;
they will be remembered forever.
7They will have no fear of bad news;
their hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.
8Their hearts are secure, they will have no fear;
in the end they will look in triumph on their foes.
9They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor,
their righteousness endures forever;
their horn will be lifted high in honor.
10The wicked will see and be vexed,
they will gnash their teeth and waste away;
the longings of the wicked will come to nothing.
