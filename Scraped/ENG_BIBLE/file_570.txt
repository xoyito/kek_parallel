PSALMS 92
A psalm. A song. For the Sabbath day.
1It is good to praise the Lord
and make music to your name, O Most High,
2proclaiming your love in the morning
and your faithfulness at night,
3to the music of the ten-stringed lyre
and the melody of the harp.
4For you make me glad by your deeds, Lord;
I sing for joy at what your hands have done.
5How great are your works, Lord,
how profound your thoughts!
6Senseless people do not know,
fools do not understand,
7that though the wicked spring up like grass
and all evildoers flourish,
they will be destroyed forever.
8But you, Lord, are forever exalted.
9For surely your enemies, Lord,
surely your enemies will perish;
all evildoers will be scattered.
10You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox;
fine oils have been poured on me.
11My eyes have seen the defeat of my adversaries;
my ears have heard the rout of my wicked foes.
12The righteous will flourish like a palm tree,
they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon;
13planted in the house of the Lord,
they will flourish in the courts of our God.
14They will still bear fruit in old age,
they will stay fresh and green,
15proclaiming, “The Lord is upright;
he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.”
