PSALMS 93
1The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty;
the Lord is robed in majesty and armed with strength;
indeed, the world is established, firm and secure.
2Your throne was established long ago;
you are from all eternity.
3The seas have lifted up, Lord,
the seas have lifted up their voice;
the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.
4Mightier than the thunder of the great waters,
mightier than the breakers of the seaâ€”
the Lord on high is mighty.
5Your statutes, Lord, stand firm;
holiness adorns your house
for endless days.
