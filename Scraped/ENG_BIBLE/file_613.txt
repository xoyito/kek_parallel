PSALMS 135
1Praise the Lord.
Praise the name of the Lord;
praise him, you servants of the Lord,
2you who minister in the house of the Lord,
in the courts of the house of our God.
3Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good;
sing praise to his name, for that is pleasant.
4For the Lord has chosen Jacob to be his own,
Israel to be his treasured possession.
5I know that the Lord is great,
that our Lord is greater than all gods.
6The Lord does whatever pleases him,
in the heavens and on the earth,
in the seas and all their depths.
7He makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth;
he sends lightning with the rain
and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
8He struck down the firstborn of Egypt,
the firstborn of people and animals.
9He sent his signs and wonders into your midst, Egypt,
against Pharaoh and all his servants.
10He struck down many nations
and killed mighty kings—
11Sihon king of the Amorites,
Og king of Bashan,
and all the kings of Canaan—
12and he gave their land as an inheritance,
an inheritance to his people Israel.
13Your name, Lord, endures forever,
your renown, Lord, through all generations.
14For the Lord will vindicate his people
and have compassion on his servants.
15The idols of the nations are silver and gold,
made by human hands.
16They have mouths, but cannot speak,
eyes, but cannot see.
17They have ears, but cannot hear,
nor is there breath in their mouths.
18Those who make them will be like them,
and so will all who trust in them.
19All you Israelites, praise the Lord;
house of Aaron, praise the Lord;
20house of Levi, praise the Lord;
you who fear him, praise the Lord.
21Praise be to the Lord from Zion,
to him who dwells in Jerusalem.
Praise the Lord.
