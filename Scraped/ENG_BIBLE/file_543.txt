PSALMS 65
For the director of music. A psalm of David. A song.
1Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion;
to you our vows will be fulfilled.
2You who answer prayer,
to you all people will come.
3When we were overwhelmed by sins,
you forgave our transgressions.
4Blessed are those you choose
and bring near to live in your courts!
We are filled with the good things of your house,
of your holy temple.
5You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds,
God our Savior,
the hope of all the ends of the earth
and of the farthest seas,
6who formed the mountains by your power,
having armed yourself with strength,
7who stilled the roaring of the seas,
the roaring of their waves,
and the turmoil of the nations.
8The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders;
where morning dawns, where evening fades,
you call forth songs of joy.
9You care for the land and water it;
you enrich it abundantly.
The streams of God are filled with water
to provide the people with grain,
for so you have ordained it.
10You drench its furrows and level its ridges;
you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
11You crown the year with your bounty,
and your carts overflow with abundance.
12The grasslands of the wilderness overflow;
the hills are clothed with gladness.
13The meadows are covered with flocks
and the valleys are mantled with grain;
they shout for joy and sing.
