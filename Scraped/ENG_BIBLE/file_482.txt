PSALMS 4
For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of David.
1Answer me when I call to you,
my righteous God.
Give me relief from my distress;
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
2How long will you people turn my glory into shame?
How long will you love delusions and seek false gods?
3Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself;
the Lord hears when I call to him.
4Tremble and do not sin;
when you are on your beds,
search your hearts and be silent.
5Offer the sacrifices of the righteous
and trust in the Lord.
6Many, Lord, are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?”
Let the light of your face shine on us.
7Fill my heart with joy
when their grain and new wine abound.
8In peace I will lie down and sleep,
for you alone, Lord,
make me dwell in safety.
