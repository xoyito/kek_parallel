JOB 23
Job
1Then Job replied:
2“Even today my complaint is bitter;
his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
3If only I knew where to find him;
if only I could go to his dwelling!
4I would state my case before him
and fill my mouth with arguments.
5I would find out what he would answer me,
and consider what he would say to me.
6Would he vigorously oppose me?
No, he would not press charges against me.
7There the upright can establish their innocence before him,
and there I would be delivered forever from my judge.
8“But if I go to the east, he is not there;
if I go to the west, I do not find him.
9When he is at work in the north, I do not see him;
when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.
10But he knows the way that I take;
when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
11My feet have closely followed his steps;
I have kept to his way without turning aside.
12I have not departed from the commands of his lips;
I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
13“But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?
He does whatever he pleases.
14He carries out his decree against me,
and many such plans he still has in store.
15That is why I am terrified before him;
when I think of all this, I fear him.
16God has made my heart faint;
the Almighty has terrified me.
17Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,
by the thick darkness that covers my face.
