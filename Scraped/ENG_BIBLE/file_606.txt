PSALMS 128
A song of ascents.
1Blessed are all who fear the Lord,
who walk in obedience to him.
2You will eat the fruit of your labor;
blessings and prosperity will be yours.
3Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
within your house;
your children will be like olive shoots
around your table.
4Yes, this will be the blessing
for the man who fears the Lord.
5May the Lord bless you from Zion;
may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
all the days of your life.
6May you live to see your children’s children—
peace be on Israel.
