PSALMS 114
1When Israel came out of Egypt,
Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,
2Judah became Godâ€™s sanctuary,
Israel his dominion.
3The sea looked and fled,
the Jordan turned back;
4the mountains leaped like rams,
the hills like lambs.
5Why was it, sea, that you fled?
Why, Jordan, did you turn back?
6Why, mountains, did you leap like rams,
you hills, like lambs?
7Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord,
at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8who turned the rock into a pool,
the hard rock into springs of water.
