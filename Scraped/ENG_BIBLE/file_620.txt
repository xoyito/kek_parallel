PSALMS 142
A maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer.
1I cry aloud to the Lord;
I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.
2I pour out before him my complaint;
before him I tell my trouble.
3When my spirit grows faint within me,
it is you who watch over my way.
In the path where I walk
people have hidden a snare for me.
4Look and see, there is no one at my right hand;
no one is concerned for me.
I have no refuge;
no one cares for my life.
5I cry to you, Lord;
I say, “You are my refuge,
my portion in the land of the living.”
6Listen to my cry,
for I am in desperate need;
rescue me from those who pursue me,
for they are too strong for me.
7Set me free from my prison,
that I may praise your name.
Then the righteous will gather about me
because of your goodness to me.
