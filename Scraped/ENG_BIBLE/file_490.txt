PSALMS 12
For the director of music. According to sheminith. A psalm of David.
1Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore;
those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
2Everyone lies to their neighbor;
they flatter with their lips
but harbor deception in their hearts.
3May the Lord silence all flattering lips
and every boastful tongue—
4those who say,
“By our tongues we will prevail;
our own lips will defend us—who is lord over us?”
5“Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan,
I will now arise,” says the Lord.
“I will protect them from those who malign them.”
6And the words of the Lord are flawless,
like silver purified in a crucible,
like gold refined seven times.
7You, Lord, will keep the needy safe
and will protect us forever from the wicked,
8who freely strut about
when what is vile is honored by the human race.
