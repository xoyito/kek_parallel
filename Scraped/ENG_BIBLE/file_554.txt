PSALMS 76
For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song.
1God is renowned in Judah;
in Israel his name is great.
2His tent is in Salem,
his dwelling place in Zion.
3There he broke the flashing arrows,
the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.
4You are radiant with light,
more majestic than mountains rich with game.
5The valiant lie plundered,
they sleep their last sleep;
not one of the warriors
can lift his hands.
6At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
both horse and chariot lie still.
7It is you alone who are to be feared.
Who can stand before you when you are angry?
8From heaven you pronounced judgment,
and the land feared and was quietâ€”
9when you, God, rose up to judge,
to save all the afflicted of the land.
10Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise,
and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.
11Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them;
let all the neighboring lands
bring gifts to the One to be feared.
12He breaks the spirit of rulers;
he is feared by the kings of the earth.
