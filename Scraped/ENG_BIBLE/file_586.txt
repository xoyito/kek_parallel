PSALMS 108
A song. A psalm of David.
1My heart, O God, is steadfast;
I will sing and make music with all my soul.
2Awake, harp and lyre!
I will awaken the dawn.
3I will praise you, Lord, among the nations;
I will sing of you among the peoples.
4For great is your love, higher than the heavens;
your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
5Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
let your glory be over all the earth.
6Save us and help us with your right hand,
that those you love may be delivered.
7God has spoken from his sanctuary:
“In triumph I will parcel out Shechem
and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.
8Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine;
Ephraim is my helmet,
Judah is my scepter.
9Moab is my washbasin,
on Edom I toss my sandal;
over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
10Who will bring me to the fortified city?
Who will lead me to Edom?
11Is it not you, God, you who have rejected us
and no longer go out with our armies?
12Give us aid against the enemy,
for human help is worthless.
13With God we will gain the victory,
and he will trample down our enemies.
