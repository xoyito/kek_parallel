ISAIAH 12
Songs of Praise
1In that day you will say:
“I will praise you, Lord.
Although you were angry with me,
your anger has turned away
and you have comforted me.
2Surely God is my salvation;
I will trust and not be afraid.
The Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my defense;
he has become my salvation.”
3With joy you will draw water
from the wells of salvation.
4In that day you will say:
“Give praise to the Lord, proclaim his name;
make known among the nations what he has done,
and proclaim that his name is exalted.
5Sing to the Lord, for he has done glorious things;
let this be known to all the world.
6Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion,
for great is the Holy One of Israel among you.”
