1 It is the duty of the Lordâ€™s clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a ahistory, and a general church brecord of all things that transpire in Zion, and of all those who cconsecrate properties, and receive dinheritances legally from the bishop;
2 And also their manner of life, their faith, and works; and also of the aapostates who apostatize after receiving their inheritances.
3 It is contrary to the will and commandment of God that those who receive not their ainheritance by bconsecration, agreeable to his claw, which he has given, that he may dtithe his people, to prepare them against the day of evengeance and burning, should have their fnames enrolled with the people of God.
4 Neither is their agenealogy to be kept, or to be had where it may be found on any of the records or history of the church.
5 Their names shall not be found, neither the names of the fathers, nor the names of the children written in the abook of the law of God, saith the Lord of Hosts.
6 Yea, thus saith the astill small voice, which whispereth through and bpierceth all things, and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest, saying:
7 And it shall come to pass that I, the Lord God, will send one mighty and strong, holding the scepter of power in his hand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of truth, to set in aorder the house of God, and to arrange by blot the cinheritances of the saints whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of their children, enrolled in the book of the law of God;
8 While that man, who was called of God and appointed, that putteth forth his hand to asteady the bark of God, shall fall by the shaft of death, like as a tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft of lightning.
9 And all they who are not found written in the abook of remembrance shall find none inheritance in that day, but they shall be cut asunder, and their portion shall be appointed them among bunbelievers, where are cwailing and gnashing of teeth.
10 These things I say not of amyself; therefore, as the Lord speaketh, he will also fulfil.
11 And they who are of the High Priesthood, whose names are not found written in the abook of the law, or that are found to have bapostatized, or to have been ccut off from the church, as well as the lesser priesthood, or the members, in that day shall dnot find an inheritance among the saints of the Most High;
12 Therefore, it shall be done unto them as unto the achildren of the bpriest, as will be found recorded in the second chapter and sixty-first and second verses of Ezra.
