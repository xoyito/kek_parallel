1 And now concerning my servant aParleyÂ P. Pratt, behold, I say unto him that as I live I will that he shall declare my gospel and blearn of me, and be meek and lowly of heart.
2 And that which I have appointed unto him is that he shall ago with my servants, Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the bLamanites.
3 And aZiba Peterson also shall go with them; and I myself will go with them and be in their bmidst; and I am their cadvocate with the Father, and nothing shall dprevail against them.
4 And they shall give aheed to that which is written, and pretend to no other brevelation; and they shall pray always that I may cunfold the same to their dunderstanding.
5 And they shall give heed unto these words and trifle not, and I will bless them. Amen.
