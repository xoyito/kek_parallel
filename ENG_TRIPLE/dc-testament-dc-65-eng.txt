1 Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty and powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice is unto men—aPrepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
2 The akeys of the bkingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the cgospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the dstone which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until it has efilled the whole earth.
3 Yea, a voice crying—aPrepare ye the way of the Lord, prepare ye the bsupper of the Lamb, make ready for the cBridegroom.
4 Pray unto the Lord, acall upon his holy name, make known his wonderful bworks among the people.
5 Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to come, in the which the Son of Man shall acome down in heaven, bclothed in the brightness of his cglory, to meet the dkingdom of God which is set up on the earth.
6 Wherefore, may the akingdom of God go forth, that the bkingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God, mayest be cglorified in heaven so on earth, that thine denemies may be subdued; for ethine is the honor, power and glory, forever and ever. Amen.
