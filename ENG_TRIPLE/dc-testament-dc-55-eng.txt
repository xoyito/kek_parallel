1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant William, yea, even the Lord of the whole aearth, thou art called and chosen; and after thou hast been bbaptized by water, which if you do with an eye single to my glory, you shall have a remission of your sins and a reception of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of chands;
2 And then thou shalt be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and aremission of sins by way of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.
3 And on whomsoever you shall alay your hands, if they are contrite before me, you shall have power to give the Holy Spirit.
4 And again, you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing abooks for bschools in this church, that little cchildren also may receive dinstruction before me as is pleasing unto me.
5 And again, verily I say unto you, for this cause you shall take your journey with my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that you may be aplanted in the land of your inheritance to do this work.
6 And again, let my servant aJoseph Coe also take his journey with them. The residue shall be made known hereafter, even as I will. Amen.
