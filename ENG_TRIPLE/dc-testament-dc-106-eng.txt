1 It is my will that my servant Warren A. Cowdery should be appointed and ordained a presiding high priest over my church, in the land of aFreedom and the regions round about;
2 And should preach my aeverlasting gospel, and lift up his voice and warn the people, not only in his own place, but in the adjoining counties;
3 And devote his whole time to this high and holy calling, which I now give unto him, aseeking diligently the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness, and all things necessary shall be added thereunto; for the blaborer is worthy of his hire.
4 And again, verily I say unto you, the acoming of the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world as a bthief in the night—
5 Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be the achildren of light, and that day shall not bovertake you as a thief.
6 And again, verily I say unto you, there was joy in heaven when my servant Warren bowed to my scepter, and separated himself from the crafts of men;
7 Therefore, blessed is my servant Warren, for I will have mercy on him; and, notwithstanding the avanity of his heart, I will lift him up inasmuch as he will humble himself before me.
8 And I will give him agrace and assurance wherewith he may stand; and if he continue to be a faithful witness and a blight unto the church I have prepared a crown for him in the cmansions of my Father. Even so. Amen.
