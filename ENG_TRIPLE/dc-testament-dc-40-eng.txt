1 Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant aJames Covel was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.
2 And he areceived the word with gladness, but straightway Satan btempted him; and the fear of cpersecution and the cares of the world caused him to dreject the word.
3 Wherefore he abroke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen.
