1 The manner which the disciples, who were called the aelders of the church, bordained cpriests and teachersâ€”
2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they alaid their hands upon them, and said:
3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest (or if he be a ateacher, I ordain you to be a teacher) to preach repentance and bremission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.
4 And after this manner did they aordain priests and teachers, according to the bgifts and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the cpower of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
