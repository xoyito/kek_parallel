1 Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant FrederickÂ G. Williams: Listen to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a ahigh priest in my church, and a bcounselor unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.;
2 Unto whom I have given the akeys of the kingdom, which belong always unto the bPresidency of the High Priesthood:
3 Therefore, verily I acknowledge him and will bless him, and also thee, inasmuch as thou art faithful in counsel, in the office which I have appointed unto you, in prayer always, vocally and in thy heart, in public and in private, also in thy aministry in proclaiming the gospel in the bland of the living, and among thy brethren.
4 And in doing these things thou wilt do the greatest agood unto thy fellow beings, and wilt promote the bglory of him who is your Lord.
5 Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; asuccor the bweak, lift up the hands which hang down, and cstrengthen the dfeeble knees.
6 And if thou art afaithful unto the end thou shalt have a bcrown of cimmortality, and eternal life in the dmansions which I have prepared in the house of my Father.
7 Behold, and lo, these are the words of Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
