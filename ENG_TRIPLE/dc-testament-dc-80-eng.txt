2 And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant aEden Smith.
3 Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.
4 Therefore, declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and aknow to be true.
5 Behold, this is the will of him who hath acalled you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
