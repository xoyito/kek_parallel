1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the aApocryphaâ€”There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly;
2 There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are ainterpolations by the hands of men.
3 Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be atranslated.
4 Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him aunderstand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;
5 And whoso is enlightened by the aSpirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;
6 And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
